      # AWS-Ec2--Remote-webApllication-hosting-
      This project demonstrates how to host a web application on AWS EC2. The application is deployed on a virtual server (EC2 instance) with a scalable and secure cloud infrastructure, leveraging various AWS services to provide a high-performance, low-cost hosting solution

      Prerequisites
      AWS account with access to EC2.
      SSH client to connect to the EC2 instance.
      Basic understanding of Linux and web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
      Steps
      Create an EC2 instance:
      
      Log in to the AWS Management Console.
      Navigate to EC2 Dashboard and launch an EC2 instance.
      Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) like Ubuntu Server or Amazon Linux.
      Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for Free Tier).
      Configure security groups to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
      Add your key pair for SSH access and launch the instance.
      Connect to your EC2 instance:
      
      Use the key pair to SSH into the instance:
      bash
      Copy code
      ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@<EC2-Public-IP>
      Install necessary software (web server):
      
      For Apache:
      bash
      Copy code
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install apache2
      sudo systemctl start apache2
      For Nginx:
      bash
      Copy code
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install nginx
      sudo systemctl start nginx
      Deploy your web application:
      
      Upload your web application files to the server.
      Place files in the web root directory (e.g., /var/www/html for Apache).
      Access the web application:
      
      Open a browser and enter the public IP of your EC2 instance to view the application.
      Usage
      Once the application is deployed and the server is running, you can access the hosted application via the public IP of your EC2 instance. For example:
      
      vbnet
      Copy code
      http://<EC2-Public-IP>
      You can configure domain names, SSL certificates (using AWS Certificate Manager), and advanced scaling features (using Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling) as needed.
      
      Architecture
      This project follows the basic cloud architecture principles:
      
      EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Hosts the web application.
      Security Group: Controls inbound and outbound traffic.
      Elastic IP: (Optional) Provides a static public IP for your application.
      Load Balancer (optional): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
      Features
      Scalable infrastructure with AWS EC2.
      Secure access via SSH and security groups.
      Web server setup with Apache/Nginx.
      (Optional) Custom domain name and SSL setup.
      (Optional) Load balancer and auto-scaling configuration.
